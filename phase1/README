The tasks from this project are split into four programs.
To run any program utilize python 3.8.5 and run 'python fileName' where fileName is the name of the program

Task 1 - gestureWords.py
This program normalizes and quantizes data from several gesture csv files in a particular directory.
The output is in the form of wrd files in the same directory which contain the same data conveyed in a lossy fashion.
Inputs:
A string containing the path to the folder of csv files
An integer indicating the window size for words 
An integer indicating the shift value for creating the words
An integer indicating the resolution of the data encoded within the words

Task 2 - createVectors.py
This program creates TF, TF-IDF, and TF-IDF2 vectors for all wrd files in a particular directory.
These vectors are compiled together for all wrd files and saved in the same directory as vectors.txt.
This program is dependent on the output of gestureWords.py
A string indicating the path to the folder of the wrd files

Task 3 - heatmap.py
This program creates a heatmap displaying the TF, TF-IDF, and TF-IDF2 values for a gesture csv file.
In order for this program to be run both gestureWords.py and createVectors.py must be run on the data in which the heatmap is being created.
A string indicating the path to the folder of the wrd files and vectors.txt
A string indicating the file name of the gesture to create a heatmap of (this includes the csv file extension)
An integer indicating the choice of values to create the heatmap with: 1 - TF, 2 - TFIDF, 3 - TFIDF2

Task 4 - query.py
This program finds the 10 most similar results to a particular gesture file.
The metric for comparison specified by the user can be TF, TF-IDF, or TF-IDF2
In order for this program to be run both gestureWords.py and createVectors.py must be run on the data in which the query is being run.
A string indicating the path to the folder of the wrd files and vectors.txt
A string indicating the file name of the gesture to query on (this includes the csv file extension)
An integer indicating the choice of values to use when comparing gestures: 1 - TF, 2 - TFIDF, 3 - TFIDF2

Helper classes
iohelpers.py
In order to help with reading the files generated by the programs a shared helper class of iohelpers helps read in the data from wrd files and vectors.txt
